Sensor "humidity" 2 
   value: Float
Sensor "motion" 3
   value: Int
Sensor "motion" 4
   value: Int


When node sends an update it would send three payloads

1 2 0.0
1 3   0 0

Receiver would know that sensor type 3 should

1  1 0.0
1  2 0.0
1  3 0 0

hub/node/1/sensor/1  68.5
hub/node/1/sensor/2  12.0
hub/node/1/sensor/3  0
hub/node/1/sensor/4  0
